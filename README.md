# WLS-Rewritten
Windows Live Spaces Rewritten Server


Windows Live spaces was a social media platform created by Microsoft many years ago. It was shut-down due to lack of users.

This project aims to revive it by entirely rewriting it in PHP and JavaScript.

Due to the copyrighted CSS themes and some elements, no source code will be posted here, however, users with private access may log issues.
